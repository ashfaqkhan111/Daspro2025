Q: If the contents of each element of the array num are changed with numbers 5.0, 12867,
7.5, 2000000. What happens? How can it be like that?

Answer: if we assign these value to the array directly it will give an error beacuse we 
        create that array as integer data type we have to change the data type to double then it will be fine.
 
 
Q:  Modify the program code by initializing the array elements at the same time when
declaring the array. 

Answer:          int [] num = {5,12,7,20};
                  
                  for (int n : num){
                  
                  System.out.print(n + " "); 
                  }     
                  
                  
 Q: Change the statement in step 6 to be like this 
 
 
     for (int i =0; i<=4; i++) {
			
			System.out.print(num[i]);
			
			What is the result? How can it be like that?
			
			
Answer: its showing error because the length of array is 4

Q: Change the statement in step 5 to be like this

             for (int i =0; i<Final_Score.length; i++) {
		
		System.out.print("Enter the final score " +i+" : ");
		Final_Score [i] = input.nextInt();
		
		un the program. Have there been any changes? How can it be like that?
		
		
		
Answer: no changes occur beacuse if we put i<10 0r i<Final_Score.length its meannig is same beacuse we initialize 
        Array Final_Score as the length [10]
        
        
        
Q:What is meant by the condition i < finalScore.length?

Answer: the meaning of this condition is repaet the loop until i reach the point which is less then the length of the finalscore array.

Q: Modify the program so that it displays all students, and mark which one passed, and
which did not!

Answer: System.out.println("\n"+"*******REsults******" +"\n");
	
	for (int i = 0; i<Final_Score.length; i++) {
		
		if (Final_Score[i] >= 70) {
			System.out.println("the student " + (i+1)+ " is PASS!! with marks : " +Final_Score[i]+"\n");
			
			
		}else {System.out.println("the Student " +(i+1)+ " is Fail!! with low marks : " + Final_Score[i]+"\n" );
		}
