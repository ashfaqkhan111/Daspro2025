# Campus Library Entry System

## Description
This simple program determines whether a student is allowed to enter the campus library based on two conditions:
1. The student brings their **student ID**, or  
2. The student has **registered online**.

If neither condition is met, the student is **denied entry**.

---

## Logic Explanation
The system uses a logical **OR** condition:

>  If (studentID == "yes" OR registeredOnline == "yes") → **Allow Entry**  
>  Else → **Deny Entry**

---

## Pseudocode
BEGIN
    DECLARE studentID AS STRING
    DECLARE registeredOnline AS STRING

    DISPLAY "Do you have a student ID? (yes/no): "
    INPUT studentID

    DISPLAY "Have you registered online? (yes/no): "
    INPUT registeredOnline

    IF (studentID == "yes" OR registeredOnline == "yes") THEN
        DISPLAY "You are allowed to enter the library."
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "You are denied entry."
    ENDIF
END
