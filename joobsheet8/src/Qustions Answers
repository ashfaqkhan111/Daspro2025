2.1 Experiment 1: Loop Review

Qustions

1. If in for loop, the initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, what is the result? How can It
be like that?

Answer: If i = 1 is changed to i = 0, the loop will print one extra star — because counting starts from 0 instead of 



2. If in for loop, condition i <= N is changed to i > N, what is the result? How can It be
like that?


Answer:If the condition i <= N is changed to i > N, the loop will not run at all, so nothing will be printed.

 
3. If in for loop, the condition for step i++ is changed to i-- what is the result? How can
It be like that?

Answer: If i++ is changed to i--, the loop will never stop — it becomes an infinite loop (runs forever).




2.2 Experiment 2: Square Star


1.Pay attention to outer loop. If in for syntax, the initialization iOuter = 1 is changed to
iOuter = 0, what is the result? How can it be like that?

Answer: If iOuter = 1 is changed to iOuter = 0, the program will print one extra row of stars.

2. Return the program to normal with initialization iOuter = 1. Then pay attention to the
inner loop. If in for syntax, the initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, what is the result?
How can it be like that?

Answer: If the inner loop initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, the program will print one extra star in each row.

3. What is the difference between outer loop and inner loop?

Answer: The outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns.

4. Why is it necessary to add the syntax System.out.println(); under inner loop? What
will happen if the syntax is omitted?

System.out.println(); is used to move to the next line after finishing one row of stars.



2.3 Experiment 3: Triangle Star


1. Look at the results, does the output produced with a value of N = 5 match the following
display?

Answer: not matching 

2. If not, which parts should be improved or added? Describe any parts that need to be
improved or added!

Answer we have to add System.out.println(); for movieng to next line .




2.4 Experiment 4: Guess the Number Quiz


1.Explain the program flow in Experiment 4!

Answer:


1. Import and setup**


import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;


 Scanner is used to take user input.
 Random is used to generate a random number between 1 and 10.



2. Variable initialization**

java
char menu = 'y';


This variable controls whether the user wants to play again or end the game.


3. Outer `do-while` loop**

do {
   
} while(menu == 'Y' || menu == 'y');


 The outer loop repeats the whole game as long as the player types y or Y.
 Each round starts a **new guessing game.


4. Generate a random number**


int number = rand.nextInt(10) + 1;

 This picks a random number between 1 and 10 for the player to guess.


5. Inner do-while loop


boolean success = false;
do {
    System.out.print("Guess the number from 1 to 10 : ");
    int answer = input.nextInt();
    input.nextLine();
    success = (answer == number);
} while(!success);

 The player keeps guessing until they get the correct number.
The condition !success means the loop continues while the guess is wrong.
 When the guess is correct, `success = true`, and the loop stops.



6. Ask to play agai


System.out.print("Do you want to play the game again : Yes / No ");
menu = input.next().charAt(0);
input.nextLine();


 The program asks if the user wants to continue.
If the user types `Y` or `y`, the outer loop repeats (game restarts).
Otherwise, it exits the loop.



7. End of program


if (menu == 'N' || menu == 'n') {
    System.out.print("THE End !!!");
}


When the user chooses N or n, the program prints THE End !!! and stops.

2. What must be done to discontinue (not repeat) the game?

Answer: To discontinue (not repeat) the game, the user must enter N or n when asked:






2.5 Experiment 5: Filling and Displaying Arrays 

Explain the program flow in Experiment 5!

Answer: 


1. Import and setup


import java.util.Scanner;

import java.util.Arrays;


Scanner used to take input from the user.




2. Create Scanner and 2D Array


Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
double [][] temps = new double[5][7];


temps is a 2D array with 5 rows and 7 columns.

  Each row represents a city.
  Each column represents a day.
 So, the array can store temperatures for 5 cities over 7 days.

3. Input Data (First Nested Loop)**


for (int i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("City (" + (i + 1) + ")");
    
    for (int j = 0; j < temps[0].length; j++) {
        System.out.print("Day '" + (j + 1) + "': ");
        temps[i][j] = input.nextDouble();
    }
    System.out.println();
}


💡 What happens:

 The outer loop (`i`) runs 5 times → once for each city.
Theinner loop (`j`) runs 7 times → once for each day.
 Inside the inner loop:

  The program asks the user to **enter a temperature** for each day.
  Each value is stored in the 2D array at position `temps[i][j]`.
 After entering 7 days for one city, it moves to the next city.

 Example prompt:


City (1)
Day '1': 28.5
Day '2': 30.1
Day '3': 29.8





4. Output Data (Second Nested Loop)**


for (int i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("City " + (i + 1));
    
    for (int j = 0; j < temps[0].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(temps[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}


What happens:

The program loops again through the same 2D array.
It prints out all the temperature values that were entered earlier.
Each row of output shows one city’s 7 temperature readings.

 Example output:


City 1
28.5 30.1 29.8 31.0 32.2 30.5 29.9 
City 2





5. Program ends

After printing all the data, the program finishes its execution.
