1. Do parameterless functions always have to be void?

Answer: NO A function without parameters can return ANY data type, for example:
public static int getNumber() {
    return 25;
}

2. Can the menu list be displayed WITHOUT using the Menu() function?

Answer: Yes just write the menu directly inside main method 

public static void main(string[]args){

System.out.println("=====Coffee Shop=====");
System.out.println("1. Balck Coffee - 15k");
System.out.println("Latte - 20k");
System.out.println("Cappucino - 30k");
System.out.println("Teh Tarik - 12k");
System.out.println("Please Choose your Drink");

}

3. Advantages of using Menu() instead of writing everything in main()

Answer: Cleaner and organized code
main() stays short and easy to read.

Reusability
You can call Menu() many times without rewriting code.

Easier to update
If the cafe menu changes, you edit one place only.

Better for teamwork
Functions divide tasks and responsibilities in large programs.

Follows good programming structure
Good habits → modular, readable, and maintainable code.


4.Execution flow when Menu() is called from main()

Answer: The program starts → Java loads the class Coffee25410702062.

Java looks for main() and begins executing it.

In main(), the line Menu(); is found.

Java jumps to the Menu() function.

All statements inside Menu() are executed:

print the coffee menu.

After finishing Menu(), execution returns back to main().

Program ends
