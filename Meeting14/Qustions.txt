Experiment 2.1

1. Do parameterless functions always have to be void?

Answer: NO A function without parameters can return ANY data type, for example:
public static int getNumber() {
    return 25;
}

2. Can the menu list be displayed WITHOUT using the Menu() function?

Answer: Yes just write the menu directly inside main method 

public static void main(string[]args){

System.out.println("=====Coffee Shop=====");
System.out.println("1. Balck Coffee - 15k");
System.out.println("Latte - 20k");
System.out.println("Cappucino - 30k");
System.out.println("Teh Tarik - 12k");
System.out.println("Please Choose your Drink");

}

3. Advantages of using Menu() instead of writing everything in main()

Answer: Cleaner and organized code
main() stays short and easy to read.

Reusability
You can call Menu() many times without rewriting code.

Easier to update
If the cafe menu changes, you edit one place only.

Better for teamwork
Functions divide tasks and responsibilities in large programs.

Follows good programming structure
Good habits → modular, readable, and maintainable code.


4.Execution flow when Menu() is called from main()

Answer: The program starts → Java loads the class Coffee25410702062.

Java looks for main() and begins executing it.

In main(), the line Menu(); is found.

Java jumps to the Menu() function.

All statements inside Menu() are executed:

print the coffee menu.

After finishing Menu(), execution returns back to main().

Program ends  

Experiment 2.2

1. What is the use of parameters in functions?

Answer: Parameters let a function receive values from the code that calls it. They make a function general and reusable by allowing different inputs to produce different outputs instead of hard-coding values inside the function.
Benefits:

Reusability (same function, different inputs)

Readability (intent is clearer)

Maintainability (change behavior by altering call, not function body)

Separation of concerns (function focuses on behavior, caller provides data)


2. Why does this experiment use parameters customerName and isMember in Menu()?

Answer: customerName is used so the function can greet. 
isMember is a flag that controls membership behavior (show discount message when true).

3. Are parameters the same as variables? Explain.

Answer: They are related but not identical:

Parameter: a name declared in function definition/signature. Example: String customerName in Menu(String customerName, ...).
Parameters are local variables inside the function that are automatically initialized with the values passed by the caller.

Variable: a general term for any named storage local variables, parameters, fields.

4.Explain how the parameter isMember works in Menu(). What changes in output when it is true vs false?

Answer: If isMember == true: the if block runs and the member discount message is printed
 (so the user sees the discount message before the menu).

If isMember == false: the if block is skipped and the discount message is not printed;
 the menu prints without the member message.

 5. What happens if you call Menu() without including parameters customerName and isMember?

 Answer: if we call the Menu() with out including parameters Compiler will give us Error.
         The method menu(String, boolean) in the type Coffee25410702062 is not applicable for the arguments ()
