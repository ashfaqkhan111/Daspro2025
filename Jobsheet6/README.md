## Objective
To create a simple Java program that determines a student's semester graduation status based on two core subjects:  
1. Algorithm and Programming  
2. Data Structure  

The program applies the concepts of:
- Data types and variables  
- Arithmetic operators  
- Input/Output  
- Conditional statements (if, else, nested if)

---

##  Problem Description
Each subject has three grading components:
- UTS (Midterm Exam): 30%  
- UAS (Final Exam): 40%  
- Tugas (Assignments): 30%  

### **Rules:**
- A student passes a subject if the final score ≥ 60.  
- The semester is passed if:
  - Both subjects are “LULUS”, **and**
  - The average of both final scores ≥ 70.

Otherwise, the semester result is “TIDAK LULUS”.
