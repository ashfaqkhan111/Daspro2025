qustions experiment 1

Q: There are 3 main components in FOR loop. Based on experiment 1 above, identify and
   explain these 3 components!


Answwr: in FOR loop there are three main compunent 
1. initialization : this part of loop run first and one time it set the initial value to the program.
2. condition: this part run after the initialazition and run after every loop iteration until the condition become true.
3. update : this part run after each loop iteration it will use like updating values as we give them in this case its i++ so it 
will incrsee the value by one after each loop iteration


Q: Explain how the following code works!


Answer: this code works like this 
                           for (){} this is initialazition of FOR loop
                           in side for loop there is integer i = 1; this is intialization
                           i<=50 yhis is condition it will check i after every loop iteration the its lessthen 50 or not .
                           i++ is the increment value it will add the value to i increase by one 
                           
                           if(){} this is inilazition of IF statement inside the For loop 
                           
                           inside is i%multiple==0 is initial as i=1 and the condition i<=50 
                           the the loop will increase the value of i by 1 and the if statement will take the modulus of that number
                           in which if the i%multiple become zero it will take that number and save it in sum veriable then after if it find the 
                           nextstatement true it 
                           i will add the sum = the number stored to that statement where it become true  
                           
                           Example: if multiple = 5 then the condition will check 1%5 = 1 = false it will goo to 5%5 = 0 this statement become
                            true it wills store the value in the sum veriable like sum = sum+i the int i = 1 become i = 10 beacuse of condition 1<=50 
                            it will be sum=sum+i so in first loop sum value is sum = 0; now sum = 0 +5; it become sum = 5; after it find another muultiple of five 
                            like 10 the value of sum will be sum=sum+i i=10; sum now is sum = 5 so sum = 5+10 sum = 15; 
                            
Counter ++ : 
             it will count how many time the loop got the condition true 
             
        
        
 Q: Modify the existing code by adding a new variable to calculate the average of all the
specified multiples!

int avrage = sum/counter;
			
			System.out.printf("the avrage of all multiple of number %d in range i to 50 is\n ", avrage,multiple);     
             
             
             
             
             
             
             
2. qustions experiment 2


Q: Do modification to make the program produce similar result but WITHOUT IF statement.
Please insert a screenshot of your code to the report

Answer : for (int i = 2; i<= NumInput; i+=2 ) {
			
				
				System.out.printf(i+" ");


this program work like it will check first for loop and then if stetment then continoue the looping like 

for(int i =1; i<=NumInput; i++) this will start the loop and in every loop iteartion check if the value is 
less or equal to the user input or not and will also increase the value of i by one 

if stetement will check the value if its true or false like i % 2 ==0 where the state ment come true it will print that value ;as

it last when i <= NumInput it will stop looping 



... by changing the initial i =1 to i = 2  and i++ to i+=2 we can get this result 





3.

Do a modification on the program therefore your program utilize FOR statement
rather than WHILE statement

Answer: if(Inputnumber <= 0) {
		System.out.print("Invalid number!!!");
		
	}
	
	else { 
		
		for( i = Inputnumber; i>0 ; i--) {
			s+="*";
			System.out.println(s);
			
			for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
				
				System.out.print("*");
				
			}
	
		}
		System.out.println();
		
		}


Q: Explain the meaning of s += “ *” and why is it possible?


Answer: its mean that the s veriable will store the value of s by increasing 1 star and it is possible beacuse we already 
have assigen and veriable of name s which is storing taht value



4.

Q: What is the use of the BREAK within the loop syntax?

Answer:  the braek statement use for to braek the loop imedeatly where we want.

			
			
Q: Modify the program so that if the number of leave days requested is greater than the
remaining entitlement, the program does not stop, allowing the user to enter the
number of days according to the entitlement.


Answer: for that we will just re move the break; statement from this condition it will continue when we enter 't' 
else {
				
				System.out.println("you dont have enough leave entitlement!");
				break;
			}			
		
		
Q: When typing "t" as the confirmation input, what happens? Why?
			
Answer: when we type 't' as input in confirmation it will end the program beacuse we give a condition like that.

else if(Confirmation.equals("t") || Confirmation.equals("T")) {
			
			System.out.print("Program END, GoodBye");
			break;
