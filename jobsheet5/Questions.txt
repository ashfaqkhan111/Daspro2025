Experiment 2.1 – IF / IF–ELSE (Print KRS)


Question 1: Why doesn't the check in the IF structure involve conditions with relational operators?
Answer: Because the variable (uktLunas) is a boolean type that already contains a true or false value.
We do not need to compare it using relational operators.
The expression "if (uktLunas)" already means "if uktLunas == true".

Question 2: When the program is run, then you enter the value false, what is the result?
Answer: When the input is false, the condition "if (uktLunas)" becomes false,
so the statements inside the IF block are not executed.
If there is no ELSE part, no message will appear.
If there is an ELSE, it will show the rejection message.

Question 3: The system needs to provide information that if the user enters a false value,
the output will be "Registration rejected. Please pay UKT first." Modify the program by adding an ELSE!
Answer:
Example code:
if (uktLunas) {
System.out.println("KRS can be printed.");
} else {
System.out.println("Registration rejected. Please pay UKT first.");
}

Experiment 2.2 – SWITCH–CASE (Print KRS)
===

Question 1: What is the function of syntax break?
Answer: The "break" statement stops the program from continuing to the next case.
Without break, the program will execute the next case(s) after the matched one (fall-through).

Question 2: What is the role of syntax default on SWITCH–CASE selection structure?
Answer: The "default" part runs when none of the case values match the input value.
It serves as a fallback for unexpected or invalid inputs.

Experiment 2.3 – Nested IF (Thesis Examination Requirements)
===

Question 1: What happens if a student answers "No" to the compensationStatus question? Why is that?
Answer: If the student answers "No", it means they are not free from compensation.
Therefore, the program will immediately show the message
"Failed: The student has not been cleared of compensation."
This happens because administrative clearance is the first and most important requirement.

Question 2: Explain the meaning of the following code snippet:
if (supervisor1 >= 8 && supervisor2 >= 4) {
Answer: This statement checks two conditions at once using the logical AND (&&) operator.
It will be true only when both conditions are true:
supervisor1 must be at least 8, and supervisor2 must be at least 4.
If either one is lower, the whole condition becomes false.

Question 3: What is the student eligibility process from start to finish? Explain it in detail for all conditions.
Answer:

1. The system asks if the student is free from compensation.

   * If No (false), display "Failed: The student has not been cleared of compensation." and stop.
   * If Yes (true), continue to guidance checks.
2. The system checks the number of guidance sessions for both supervisors.

   * If Supervisor 1 >= 8 and Supervisor 2 >= 4 → eligible to register.
   * If Supervisor 1 < 8 and Supervisor 2 >= 4 → fail, Supervisor 1 insufficient.
   * If Supervisor 1 >= 8 and Supervisor 2 < 4 → fail, Supervisor 2 insufficient.
   * If both below requirements → fail, both insufficient.
3. The program prints a message explaining whether the student is eligible or not,
   along with the reason for failure if applicable.
